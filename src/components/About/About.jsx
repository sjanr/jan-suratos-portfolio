        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Jan Suratos, an Interactive Systems Engineer
          passionate about crafting expressive and intelligent experiences that blend design, 
          art, and computation. My work explores how technology can feel alive—how systems 
          can respond, adapt, and move with the same intentionality as living things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied Computer Science at UBC Okanagan, where I specialized in 
          Human–Computer Interaction and game-related AI. From designing multi-platform 
          collaboration systems in VR and large displays, to creating emotionally resonant 
          games like <em>Wings of Legacy</em>, I bridge research and creativity to build 
          interfaces that inspire empathy and curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether I’m engineering real-time interactions or choreographing animation and light, 
          my goal is the same—to craft systems that invite people to feel present, curious, 
          and connected.
